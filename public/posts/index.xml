&lt;p&gt;Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are one of the most important tools in the fight against online censorship.

Because of these and other abilities, citizens of authoritarian regimes can get news, entertainment, and other information otherwise unavailable to them. A VPN, though, is not a panacea, and even the best VPNs have limitations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
